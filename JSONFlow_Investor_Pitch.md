## The Problem

- **Limited Accessibility:**  
  The majority of AI and blockchain systems require specialized programming knowledge, excluding non-technical users from meaningful participation and stifling innovation.

- **Complexity in Smart Contracts:**  
  Writing and deploying smart contracts remains a technical hurdle, slowing the adoption of blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions.

- **Human-Machine Divide:**  
  There is a persistent disconnect between how humans express intent and how machines interpret and execute instructions, creating friction and inefficiency.
